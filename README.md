# mjrusso's .emacs.d

My personalized Emacs configuration. _([other dotfiles](https://github.com/mjrusso/dotfiles/))_

Packages are installed via
[straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el), in conjunction with
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package). (See
[@jeffkreeftmeijer](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer)'s
[tutorial](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/emacs-straight-use-package/) for more
details.)

## thanks

This configuration is heavily adapted from
[@technomancy](https://github.com/technomancy/)'s
[.emacs.d](https://github.com/technomancy/dotfiles/tree/master/.emacs.d), as
well as [emacs-starter-kit
v3](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/v3) and
[v2](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/v2).
